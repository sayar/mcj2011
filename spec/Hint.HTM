	This year's problem will involve web technologies. You'll need to implement an 
	application that services HTTP requests. In addition, your application will 
	need to make HTTP requests out to other applications on the web. The HTTP 
	protocol will serve as an API to your application. An example of an HTTP 
	conversation is given below. Your application should handle large numbers 
	of simultaneous incoming HTTP requests as well as generate large numbers of 
	outgoing requests.

	Your solution will be submitted to the judges as a <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">virtual box</a> vm. Make sure you have 
	Virtual Box  set up and running before the competition.

	A desktop application will be provided to you to help you develop your solution. It will require the Java runtime to run. Make sure you have 
	Sun JRE 1.6.0_25 or later installed.
